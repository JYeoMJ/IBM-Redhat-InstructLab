# InstructLab Quick Reference Guide

## What is InstructLab?
InstructLab is an open-source framework for fine-tuning small language models using LAB (Large-Scale Alignment for ChatBots) methodology. Its key innovation is converting a few examples into synthetic training data for effective model fine-tuning.

## Key Benefits
- **Cost Optimization**: More cost-effective than running large model inference
- **Performance**: Lower latency for specific tasks
- **Reliability**: More reliable than RAG (no retriever bottleneck)
- **Adaptability**: Works well with frequently changing data
- **Domain Focus**: Excellent for specific enterprise use-cases

## How it Works
1. **Teacher Model** creates synthetic training data
2. **Content Filter** ensures quality and safety
3. **Student Model** gets fine-tuned
4. Uses structured knowledge and skills trees
5. Prevents catastrophic forgetting through replay buffers

## Data Requirements
- Minimum 5 high-quality examples needed
- Examples organized in YAML format (Q&A pairs)
- Can be knowledge-based or skills-based
- Training data gets synthetically expanded
- Examples must be well-structured in taxonomy trees

## Accessibility Features
- CLI tools provided for easy workflow
- Low technical knowledge barrier
- Community-driven development
- Clear contribution guidelines
- Open source (Apache-2 license)

## Best Practices
- Use small learning rates
- Include warm-up cycles in training
- Balance data across different skills
- Structure knowledge in taxonomy trees
- Focus on one specific task/domain
- Normalize inputs across taxonomy nodes

## Training Process
### Knowledge Tuning
- Integrates new factual information
- Divided into short and long response training

### Skills Tuning
- Enhances model's ability to apply knowledge
- Focuses on compositional skills
- Uses extended warm-up cycles
- Employs large effective batch sizes for stability

## Key Concepts to Remember
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Few examples â†’ millions of training samples
- **Taxonomy-Based Organization**: Structured knowledge/skills trees
- **Community Focus**: Pull request-based workflow
- **Stability**: Uses replay buffers to prevent forgetting
- **Efficiency**: Targeted fine-tuning for specific use cases

## Advantages Over Traditional Approaches
- More cost-effective than large model inference
- Better for domain-specific applications
- Lower latency for specific tasks
- Improved handling of high-frequency data changes
- More accessible than RAG (which can be bottlenecked by retriever quality)
