      Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong delivered his National Day Rally speech on August 20, 2023, at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) Headquarters in Ang Mo Kio under the theme "A Better Home, A Brighter Future." PM Lee began by celebrating Singapore's resilience in overcoming COVID-19, the most significant challenge since Independence, emerging stronger and more united.

The Ukraine war remains a human tragedy and assault on global norms, highlighting the importance of a strong SAF.

      Singapore faces rapid population aging, with one in five Singaporeans currently aged 65 or above, projected to reach one in four by 2030. The number of centenarians is expected to double from about 1,500 currently to 2,000 by 2030. To support this demographic shift, the government launched Healthier SG and expanded Active Ageing Centres (AACs). PM Lee visited Bedok Radiance AAC, which offers diverse programs from exercise classes to communal meals and volunteer initiatives. Seniors actively organize activities, including meal deliveries to frail seniors in rental flats. The centers introduce male-focused activities and café corners to attract more male participants. AACs serve as vital community spaces combating loneliness and fostering purpose among seniors.

Prime flats in central locations have the highest subsidies and strictest restrictions. Singles gain expanded access to 2-room Flexi flats across all project types. The government commits to delivering 100,000 new flats between 2021-2025, with 50,000 already launched since 2021.
