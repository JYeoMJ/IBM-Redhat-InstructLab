Synthethic data-based alignmnet tuning for Large Language Models (LLMs), using the Large-Scale Alignment for ChatBots (LAB) methodology. LAB is a method for adding new knowledge and skills to existing foundation models by generating synthetic data for the new capability, and then using the generated data to instruction tune the foundation model.

* Generate Examples: High quality, hand-curated knowledge sources, plus curated taxonomy of tasks with human-generated examples for each.
* Teacher Model(s): Teacher model generates "curriculum" of millions of question-answer pairs for the taxonomies.
* Critic Model(s): Critic model filters questions for correctness and quality. Synthetic data is scanned for prohibited material.
* Student Model(s): Student model is trained with the curriculum using novel training approach.

## Key Concepts:

* Knowledge: Adding knowledge means including files with facts, data, policies etc.
* Composition Skills: Adding compositional skills means adding and improving complex behaviours in the model's responses, e.g. act like a personality, classify a transcript, extract information from a table.

## InstructLab CLI Workflow

LAB reduces Instruction Tuning to defining recipes for synthetic data generation.

  generate-->train
  train[Re-train]-->|Chat with<br/>the re-trained LLM<br/>to see the results|chat
```

Add knowledge and skills to the LLM within the taxonomy repository. Use `ilab` to generate synthetic training data based on changes in local `taxonomy` repository. Re-train LLM with new training data. Chat with re-trained LLM to see results.

## Initialization and Model Downloads

Granite will be used as a model server for API requests, and Merlinite will perform the Synthetic Data Generation step. Note at this step, we have not downloaded the Student Model yet.

```bash
# navigate to InstructLab folder, activate python virtual environment
cd ~/instructlab
source venv/bin/activate

# verify ilab installed
ilab

# initialize ilab
ilab config init

# download models - Granite (model server for API requests), Merlinite (Synthetic Data Generation)
ilab model download --repository instructlab/granite-7b-lab-GGUF --filename=granite-7b-lab-Q4_K_M.gguf
ilab model download --repository instructlab/merlinite-7b-lab-GGUF --filename=merlinite-7b-lab-Q4_K_M.gguf

# inspect downloaded models
ilab model list
```

Test serve and chat with Granite model:

```bash
# serve Granite model
ilab model serve --model-path /home/instruct/.cache/instructlab/models/granite-7b-lab-Q4_K_M.gguf

# begin chat session with ilab model chat (type "exit" to quit chat)
ilab model chat -m /home/instruct/.cache/instructlab/models/granite-7b-lab-Q4_K_M.gguf
```

## `ilab` Directory Layout

After running `ilab config init` your directories will look like the following on a Linux system:

| **Directory**                              | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `~/.cache/instructlab/models/`             | Contains all downloaded large language models, including the saved output of ones you generate with ilab.|
| `~/.local/share/instructlab/datasets/`     | Contains data output from the SDG phase, built on modifications to the taxonomy repository.   |
| `~/.local/share/instructlab/taxonomy/`     | Contains the skill and knowledge data.                                              |
| `~/.local/share/instructlab/checkpoints/`  | Contains the output of the training process.                                |
| `~/.config/instructlab/config.yaml`        | Contains the `config.yaml` file |

You can view your `config.yaml` file with the following command (use `-k` to show a specific config section and/or `-wc` to show without comments):

```bash
ilab config show
```

## Create New Knowledge/Skills for Training Model

Inspecting Taxonomy Directory:

```bash
# navigate to taxonomy directory
cd /home/instruct/.local/share/instructlab
tree taxonomy | head -n 10
```

Contribute knowledge or compositional skills:

```bash
# create directory for adding new knowledge
mkdir -p /home/instruct/.local/share/instructlab/taxonomy/knowledge/parasol/claims

# copy example qna.yaml file to taxonomy directory
cp -av ~/files/backToTheFuture/qna.yaml /home/instruct/.local/share/instructlab/taxonomy/knowledge/parasol/claims/

# inspect file
head /home/instruct/.local/share/instructlab/taxonomy/knowledge/parasol/claims/qna.yaml

# inspect full file
cat /home/instruct/.local/share/instructlab/taxonomy/knowledge/parasol/claims/qna.yaml
```

List and validate new data - use `ilab taxonomy diff` to ensure new knowledge is properly formatted and registered.

```bash
# validate taxonomy
ilab taxonomy diff
```

## Knowledge Contribution

While skills are foundational or performative, knowledge is based more on answering questions that involve facts, data, or references.

* Each knowledge node in the tree has a `qna.yaml`
* Knowledge submissions require creation of a Git repository, contain the markdown files of knowledge contributions.
* Contributions must use the markdown (`.md`) format

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There is a limit to how much content can exist in the question/answer pairs for the model to process. Due to this, only add a maximum of around 2300 words to your question and answer seed example pairs in the `qna.yaml` file.

## Skill Contribution

Skills require smaller volume of content than knowledge contributions. Skill contribution pull requests must include the following:

* A `qna.yaml` each containing a minimum of five question-answer pairs.
* An `attribution.txt` that includes the sources of information used in the `qna.yaml`

> [!TIP]
> The skill taxonomy structure is used in several ways:
>
> 1. To select the right subset of the taxonomy to use for data generation.
> 2. To determine the interpretability by human contributors and maintainers.
> 3. As part of the prompt to the LLM used to generate synthetic samples.
<!-- -->
> [!IMPORTANT]
> There is a limit to how much content can exist in the question/answer pairs for the model to process. Due to this, only add a maximum
> of around 2300 words to your question and answer seed example pairs in the `qna.yaml` file.

### Skill YAML Template

Skills can either be grounded (includes a context) or ungrounded (does not include a context), where the grounding is declared in the taxonomy tree.

```yaml
version: 2 	# DO NOT CHANGE
task_description: Provide a description of the skill
created_by: "YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME"
seed_examples:
  - question: Question for the model
    answer: |
      The desired response from the model
  - context: |
      Grounded skills require the user to provide context containing information that the model is expected to take into account during processing. This is different from knowledge, where the model is expected to gain facts and background knowledge from the tuning process. The context key should not be used for ungrounded skills.
    question: <string>
    answer: |
      <multi-line string>
  ...
```

Then, you create an `attribution.txt` file that includes the sources of your information. These can also be self authored sources.

## Synthetic Data Generation

```bash
# synthetic data generation 
# keep pipeline at simple, ignore sdg-scale-factor in practice
ilab data generate --model /home/instruct/.cache/instructlab/models/merlinite-7b-lab-Q4_K_M.gguf --sdg-scale-factor 5 --pipeline simple --gpus 1

# Generate synthetic data with the simple pipeline
ilab data generate \
  --model /home/instruct/.cache/instructlab/models/merlinite-7b-lab-Q4_K_M.gguf \
  --pipeline simple \
  --gpus 1

# verify files have been created
ilab data list

# inspect generated data
cat /home/instruct/.local/share/instructlab/datasets/knowledge_train_msgs[YOUR_TIMESTAMP].jsonl

cat /home/instruct/.local/share/instructlab/datasets/knowledge_train_msgs_2024-12-04T07_01_16.jsonl

```

## Model Training Step

Download the `granite-7b-lab` model for training:

```bash
# To download student/base model
ilab model download --repository instructlab/granite-7b-lab

# To train the model (note most recent generation will be defaulted)
ilab model train --pipeline simple --device cuda --gpus 1
```

## Serve the Newly Trained Model

```bash
# To serve the newly trained model
ilab model serve --model-path ~/.local/share/instructlab/checkpoints/ggml-model-f16.gguf
```
