# National Day Rally 2024

Prime Minister Lawrence Wong delivered his first National Day Rally speech on August 18, 2024, at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) Headquarters in Ang Mo Kio. Speaking in Malay, Mandarin, and English, he addressed key national concerns and introduced policies aimed at inspiring Singaporeans under the theme **"A Singapore Where We Realise Our Dreams."**

PM Wong began by acknowledging the challenges facing Singapore, including geopolitical tensions, technological disruptions, and the existential threat of climate change. He emphasized that bold and transformative actions would be needed to secure a prosperous future for all Singaporeans.

## Economy

In his speech, PM Wong introduced several initiatives aimed at enhancing Singapore’s economic resilience and competitiveness. Recognizing the concerns of workers and businesses, he announced the **SkillsFuture Level-Up Program**, which provides a $4,000 SkillsFuture Credit top-up for Singaporeans aged 40 and above. This initiative also includes a training allowance of up to $3,000 per month for full-time learners, available for 24 months, amounting to a total of $72,000.

For workers facing retrenchment, the government will introduce the **SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support Scheme**, offering financial aid of up to $6,000 over six months. This scheme requires participants to engage in training, career coaching, and job-matching services, ensuring that they are better equipped for new opportunities in the evolving job market.

To support businesses, PM Wong announced a comprehensive review of government rules and regulations aimed at reducing the regulatory burden. Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong will lead this review, working closely with other ministers to streamline processes and maintain Singapore’s position as a competitive and business-friendly hub.

## Families

PM Wong reaffirmed the government’s commitment to building a family-friendly society. To alleviate the cost of raising children, he announced measures to make preschool education more affordable. The target is to align preschool fees at government-supported centers with primary school costs, setting fees at $300 per month for dual-income families and as low as $3 per month for lower-income families.

Recognizing the importance of parental leave, the government will make four weeks of paternity leave mandatory for all eligible fathers starting in April 2024. Additionally, a new **Shared Parental Leave Scheme** will be progressively implemented, providing parents with 10 weeks of shared leave. The first six weeks will be available from April 2025, with the full 10 weeks rolled out by April 2026.

PM Wong also hinted at a forthcoming **Large Families Scheme** to support families with three or more children, with details to be revealed in the 2025 Budget. This initiative aims to ease financial burdens and encourage larger families.

## Housing

Addressing the housing needs of Singaporeans, PM Wong highlighted ongoing efforts to increase the supply of Build-to-Order (BTO) flats. The government is on track to deliver 100,000 new flats between 2021 and 2025, with 80,000 units expected to be completed by December 2024.

To make housing more affordable, the government will enhance the CPF Housing Grant for first-time homebuyers, particularly those from lower-income groups. Additionally, a new BTO classification system has been introduced, categorizing flats into **Standard**, **Plus**, and **Prime** categories. Standard flats will be widely available, Plus flats will offer additional subsidies for choicer locations, and Prime flats will provide the highest subsidies for premium locations with stricter resale conditions.

PM Wong provided examples to illustrate affordability, such as a four-room Plus flat at Bayshore Vista priced at $580,000. With grants and HDB loans, young couples will be able to afford such flats with minimal cash outlay.

## Education

In the area of education, PM Wong announced significant changes to ensure inclusivity and flexibility. The longstanding Gifted Education Programme (GEP) in primary schools will be replaced with school-based programs that cater to high-ability learners. These programs will allow students to pursue their strengths while staying connected with their peers. Additional after-school enrichment modules will also be introduced for further academic stretch.

The government will continue to support non-traditional education pathways, such as the arts. PM Wong highlighted the establishment of the **University of the Arts Singapore**, which will offer degree programs subsidized for local students. He also mentioned the **ITE Progression Award**, which provides a $5,000 Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA) top-up upon enrollment in diploma programs and a $10,000 CPF top-up upon diploma completion, encouraging vocational excellence.

## Infrastructure Development

PM Wong outlined ambitious plans to enhance Singapore’s infrastructure. The **Kallang Alive Masterplan** will see the construction of a new 18,000-capacity indoor arena and centralized training facilities for Team Singapore athletes. The Singapore Sports School will also be relocated to Kallang, creating a hub for student and senior athletes to train and excel.

The government is also focusing on waterfront development. Key projects include the upcoming **NS Square**, which will become the new home for National Day Parades, and the **Founders’ Memorial**, located at the heart of Bay East Gardens. Residential precincts such as Nicoll, Kampong Bugis, Tanjong Rhu, Marina South, and Marina East will be developed, offering new opportunities for urban living.

## Conclusion

In his closing remarks, PM Wong expressed optimism about Singapore’s future and called on all Singaporeans to work together in achieving shared goals. He reiterated the importance of adapting to change and seizing opportunities to create a society where everyone can thrive. With bold policies and initiatives, the government aims to build a resilient, inclusive, and forward-looking Singapore.
