# National Day Rally 2023

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong delivered his National Day Rally speech on August 20, 2023, at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) Headquarters in Ang Mo Kio. Speaking in Malay, Mandarin, and English, he addressed key national concerns and initiatives under the theme **"A Better Home, A Brighter Future."**

## Return to Normalcy and Global Situation

PM Lee began by celebrating Singapore’s resilience in overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic, which he described as the most significant challenge since Independence. He expressed pride in how the nation emerged stronger, more resilient, and united. However, he cautioned that new challenges loom ahead, with the international landscape marked by geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties. 

The deepening rivalry between the US and China continues to affect countries worldwide, requiring careful navigation to avoid entanglement. The ongoing war in Ukraine remains a human tragedy and an assault on global norms, underscoring the importance of a strong SAF to safeguard Singapore’s sovereignty. Economic challenges persist as globalization weakens, supply chains fragment, and protectionist measures rise. Climate change, bringing more extreme weather events, also threatens food production and prices. PM Lee emphasized the need for Singapore to adapt swiftly to these multifaceted pressures.

## Forward Singapore and Economic Outlook

Despite these global challenges, PM Lee noted that Singapore’s economy remains resilient, with positive growth expected for the year. Inflation has started to ease but remains higher than pre-pandemic levels, continuing to be a concern for households. The government, he assured, will provide steadfast support to help citizens weather these economic pressures.

He highlighted the Forward Singapore initiative, spearheaded by DPM Lawrence Wong and the 4G team, which aims to refresh Singapore’s social compact. Through extensive consultations with thousands of Singaporeans, the initiative has gathered insights on equipping citizens with future-ready skills, improving care for vulnerable groups, and fostering social solidarity. The resulting report, due later this year, will serve as a roadmap for navigating future challenges and seizing emerging opportunities.

## Retirement and the Majulah Package

Addressing concerns about retirement, PM Lee announced the Majulah Package, a $7 billion initiative aimed at helping “Young Seniors” aged 50 and above secure their retirement. The package includes an Earn and Save Bonus, which provides lower- and middle-income workers with annual CPF contributions of up to $1,000. Additionally, a one-time Retirement Savings Bonus of up to $1,500 will be given to those with lower CPF balances, including homemakers and others who have not been in the formal workforce. To address healthcare costs, a one-time MediSave Bonus of up to $1,000 will also be provided. 

This initiative, which will benefit approximately 1.4 million Singaporeans across several generations, complements existing schemes like the Silver Support Scheme and Workfare, reinforcing the government’s commitment to ensuring seniors can retire with dignity and security.

## Ageing Population and Active Ageing

Singapore faces one of the fastest ageing populations globally, with one in five Singaporeans currently aged 65 or above—a figure projected to rise to one in four by 2030. To support seniors in staying healthy and socially connected, PM Lee emphasized the government’s investments in programs like Healthier SG and the expansion of Active Ageing Centres (AACs). He highlighted his visit to the Bedok Radiance AAC, where seniors actively participate in programs such as exercise classes, communal meals, and even volunteer-led initiatives. These centers, he noted, are vital for combating loneliness and fostering a sense of purpose among seniors.

## Making HDB Homes and Precincts More Senior-Friendly

To enable seniors to age comfortably in their own homes and neighborhoods, PM Lee announced enhancements to the EASE 2.0 program, which will offer more senior-friendly home modifications, such as foldable shower seats and widened toilet entrances for wheelchair access. Neighborhoods will also be upgraded with features like longer crossing times at pedestrian signals, barrier-free pathways, and more prominent block signage. Assisted living facilities, such as the Integrated Dementia Assisted Living (IDeAL) project, will also be expanded to meet the diverse needs of ageing residents.

## Housing Transformation

Housing policy took center stage as PM Lee introduced a new classification framework to replace the traditional Mature and Non-Mature Estate model. The new system categorizes flats into Standard, Plus, and Prime types. Standard flats will remain widely accessible with standard subsidies and conditions. Plus flats, located in choicer areas, will receive additional subsidies but come with stricter resale conditions to ensure fairness. Prime flats, situated in the most central locations, will have the highest subsidies and the tightest restrictions to balance affordability and social equity.

PM Lee also announced expanded housing access for singles, who will soon be able to purchase 2-room Flexi flats across all project types. He reiterated the government’s commitment to delivering 100,000 new flats between 2021 and 2025, ensuring housing remains accessible and affordable for all Singaporeans.

## Leadership Succession and Founding Values

PM Lee reaffirmed that his succession plans, delayed by the pandemic, are now back on track. He expressed full confidence in DPM Lawrence Wong and the 4G team, emphasizing their readiness to lead Singapore forward through initiatives like Forward Singapore. He urged citizens to support the next generation of leaders in building a resilient and inclusive nation.

Reflecting on Singapore’s founding values—justice, equality, racial harmony, and incorruptibility—PM Lee highlighted their continued relevance in fostering a high-trust society. He called on Singaporeans to uphold these ideals, which have guided the nation’s journey from “mudflats to metropolis.”

## Conclusion

In his closing remarks, PM Lee expressed optimism about Singapore’s future, calling for collective effort to overcome challenges and seize opportunities. He reminded citizens of the indomitable spirit that has defined the nation’s success and encouraged them to work together with renewed vigor to build a better and brighter Singapore for generations to come.
